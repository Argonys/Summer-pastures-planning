# My summer Pastures' battle plan !

So, welcome on my _battle plan_ for these Pastures !

## First week (06/07 -> 10/07)

Monday (today...) I'll do this planning and **take a last look** on the last project, in order to completely understand the backend side. (I worked a lot more on the frontend)
I'll also **add more infos** on my LinkedIn profile because it's not complete right now.
I'll check for **internship opportunities** later today or tomorrow if I don't have enough time.

During the rest of the week, I will learn more on **_React_**. Even though I worked with React on the project, I didn't grasp all of the concepts related to React.

## Week 2 (13/07 -> 17/07)

First of all : if I think it's necessary, maybe I'll **continue** my in-depth study of React.
Then, I will give a try to the **_Wordpress project_** that Nico gave us at the beginning of the lockdown.
However, someone said to me that Wordpress is also important to know/master when searching for an internship or a job so it won't be wasted time.

## Week 3 (20/07 -> 24/07)

Right now it's difficult for me to project myself in too weeks and know what I'll doing at that moment.
Maybe I'll already have an internship opportunity at that point (let me dream...) and I'll know which technologies to explore, maybe I'm gonna want to do something else than Wordpress, or I will have found an idea for my personal project... **I don't know** ! So for the moment, let's say I will work a bit more on Wordpress during this week.

## ~~Week 4 (27/07 -> 31/07)~~

### Sorry but it's holidays ! We're closed !

That's all I can do for the moment. It's not August yet...
