# My summer Pastures' battle plan !

So, welcome on my _battle plan_ for these Pastures !

## First week (06/07 -> 10/07)

Monday (today...) I'll do this planning and **take a last look** on the last project, in order to completely understand the backend side. (I worked a lot more on the frontend)
I'll also **add more infos** on my LinkedIn profile because it's not complete right now.
I'll check for **internship opportunities** later today or tomorrow if I don't have enough time.

During the rest of the week, I will learn more on **_React_**. Even though I worked with React on the project, I didn't grasp all of the concepts related to React.

## Week 2 (13/07 -> 17/07)

First of all : if I think it's necessary, maybe I'll **continue** my in-depth study of React.
Then, I will give a try to the **_Wordpress project_** that Nico gave us at the beginning of the lockdown.
However, someone said to me that Wordpress is also important to know/master when searching for an internship or a job so it won't be wasted time.

## Week 3 (20/07 -> 24/07)

Right now it's difficult for me to project myself in too weeks and know what I'll doing at that moment.
Maybe I'll already have an internship opportunity at that point (let me dream...) and I'll know which technologies to explore, maybe I'm gonna want to do something else than Wordpress, or I will have found an idea for my personal project... **I don't know** ! So for the moment, let's say I will work a bit more on Wordpress during this week.

## ~~Week 4 (27/07 -> 31/07)~~

### Sorry but it's holidays ! We're closed !

---

Ok, now we are in August !

## Week 5 (03/08 -> 07/08)

*So, my interview before the holidays went well, the person said that it was OK for him and that I can do my internship in his company. He said that they work with Angular and proposed me to work on the mobile version of one of their products (or work on a PWA). I think it's ok for me, it was my request to possibly work on a mobile app.*

I didn't start Angular the friday before hollidays so I'll start it now! Firstly I'll start with Angular alone and then see how the framework Ionic works with Angular (because they talked about it during my interview). But for this week, I'll only work with Angular (openclassroom tutorials, video tutorials...).

## Week 6 (10/08 -> 14/08)

I'll continue my project with Angular and perhaps start with Ionic, to see how it works. 

## Week 7 (17/08 -> 21/08)

There, I think it will be time to really start with Ionic and do something with it.

## Week 8 (24/08 -> 28/08)

*Work in progress... -> I prefer not to plan my weeks too early so I'll update these next weeks later...
## Week 9 (31/08 -> 04/09)

*Work in progress...*

## Week 10 (07/09 -> 11/09)

*Work in progress...*

## Week 11 (14/09 -> 18/09)

Beginning of my internship? I don't know if this is still scheduled for this date or if it's for the previous week...
